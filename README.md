## MVC / MVP / MVVM 
### Why shall View "interactive" with Model
Case One: an complex form that visibility of some fields depend on other fields' value. The implementation would be User interactive with `View`, and `View` set value to `Model`. `View` reflect changes from `Model` by updating its display.

## Templates
  - shall have
    - include (partial) another file
    - inherintence / override
  - mustache and handlerbars doest have both
  - dust looks good
  - is React.js fit well as template or think it more as `View`?
  - 
  
## Some combinations?
  - Backbone + Reactive
  - React + Reactive
  - Elm
  - etc...
